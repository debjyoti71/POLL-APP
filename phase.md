Perfect — here is a **complete, production-level Django roadmap** made exactly for **interview preparation**.
Not beginner fluff — this is the **A–Z list of everything a Python/Django developer is expected to know in a real job**.

This is the same roadmap used by companies when evaluating Django developers.

---

# 💯 **Django Production-Level Roadmap (Interview Focused)**

I’m dividing the roadmap into **6 Phases**, and each phase has **exact deliverables**.

---

# ✅ **PHASE 1 — Django Core Fundamentals (Absolute Must-Know)**

### ✔ Understand Django Architecture

### ✔ Django Models

* Fields (CharField, IntegerField, DateField, etc.)
* Validations
* Meta options
* Abstract vs. Concrete models

### ✔ ORM Queries

* `filter()`, `get()`, `exclude()`, `values()`, `values_list()`

---

# ✅ **PHASE 4 — Django Advanced (This separates Juniors from Django Developers)**

### ✔ Class Based Views (CBV)

* ListView
* DetailView
* CreateView
* UpdateView
* DeleteView
* Customizing CBVs

### ✔ Middleware

* Built-in middleware
* How to create custom middleware
* Use cases (logging, auth, rate-limiting)

### ✔ Signals

* post_delete
* User creation signals
* Email sending via signals

### ✔ Caching

* In-memory cache
* Redis cache
* Per-view cache
* Low-level cache API

### ✔ File Handling

* File upload
* ImageField
* S3 storage

### ✔ Logging

* Logging config
* Log levels
* File-based logs

### ✔ Environment Management

* env files
* decouple
* python-dotenv
* Different settings for dev/prod

### **Deliverable**:

You understand Django internals, signals, middleware, CBVs.

---

# ✅ **PHASE 5 — Django REST Framework (DRF)**

### ✔ API Basics

* Serializers
* ModelSerializers
* APIView
* Generic Views
* ViewSets
* Routers

### ✔ Auth in APIs

* Token auth
* JWT auth
* Permission classes
* Throttling

### ✔ Advanced

* Pagination
* Filters
* Search
* Versioning
* File upload in API
* Response formats

### **Deliverable**:

You can build full REST APIs with authentication.

---

# ✅ **PHASE 6 — Production-Level Skills**

These are the skills companies expect for backend positions.

### ✔ Deployment

* Gunicorn
* Nginx
* Dockerize Django
* Static files (collectstatic)
* Media files
* Environment variables
* Reverse proxy
* Railway / Render / AWS EC2

### ✔ Performance Optimization

* Query optimization
* Redis caching
* Async views
* Scaling app
* Load balancing basics

### ✔ Testing

* Unit tests
* Client tests
* API tests with DRF

### ✔ CI/CD (Optional but strong advantage)

* GitHub actions
* Automated tests
* Deploy on push

### ✔ System Design for Django

* Large project structure
* Microservices vs Monolith
* Task queues (Celery)
* WebSockets (Channels)

### **Deliverable**:

You can deploy and optimize a real Django application.

---

# 🔥 **Final Deliverable — One Solid Project (Interview-Ready)**

Project should include:

✔ Authentication
✔ Models + ORM
✔ Admin customization
✔ Website + Templates
✔ REST APIs
✔ Caching
✔ Deployment
✔ Role-based access

**Project Ideas:**

* Inventory Management System
* Blog + Comments + API
* E-commerce Mini
* Task Manager with roles

(Inventory is best for you because you have prior experience.)

---

# 🎯 **Last Step — Interview Preparation**

### Must prepare:

* 50 Django interview questions
* 20 Python backend questions
* 10 system design questions for Django
* 10 DRF questions
* 10 deployment questions

I can give you all of these.

# ✔ If you want, I can also prepare:

### 📌 Full **7-Day Detailed Timetable**

### 📌 Topics to study everyday

### 📌 Tasks + coding practice

### 📌 Project structure + code

### 📌 Interview cheat-sheet

Just say:
**“Make 1-week schedule from this roadmap”**
